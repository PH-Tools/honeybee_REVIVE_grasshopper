# Honeybee-REVIVE-Grasshopper
### A Phius-REVIVE plugin for Rhino/Grasshopper

This repository contains all the [Rhino-Grasshopper](https://www.rhino3d.com/) components for the Honeybee-REVIVE plugin.

Once installed, these new Grasshopper components will allow you to add detailed 'REVIVE' style data to your Honeybee models, and to calculate the ADORB cost directly within Grasshopper.

The repository includes both the UserObjects (.ghuser) and the Python source code (.py). Note that this library only possesses the Grasshopper UI components. In order to use the plugin to calculate the ADORB cost, the core [Honeybee-REVIVE](https://pypi.org/project/honeybee-REVIVE/) and [PH-ADORB](https://pypi.org/project/PH-ADORB/) python packages must also be installed.

#### *Note: Honeybee-REVIVE-Grasshopper is in no way affiliated with Phius, and the library here is neither reviewed, nor approved by Phius for use in complying with the REVIVE program. This library is for research and testing purposes ONLY.*
