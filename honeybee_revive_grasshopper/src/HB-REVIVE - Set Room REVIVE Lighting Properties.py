        _cost: (float) The total cost of the room's lighting.

        _labor_fraction: (float) The percentage of the room's lighting cost
            with is associated with labor, as opposed to material.

        _lifetime_years: (float) The lifetime (in years) of the room's lighting.

        _hb_rooms: (list[Room]) The Honeybee-Rooms to have the Lighting properties
            set on.
